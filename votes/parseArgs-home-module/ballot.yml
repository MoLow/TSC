# The goal of this vote is to determine whether the API should be exposed as
# `require('node:process').parseArgs` or `require('node:util').parseArgs`.
# Voting here is not an endorsement of the current state of the PR on the node
# repo, which is still bound to the usual rules regarding objections and code review.
#
# See https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/42675 for more context.
